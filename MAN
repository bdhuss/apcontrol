NAME:
	apcontrol - Organizes and manages a list of access points

SYNOPSIS:
	apcontrol [FUNCTION] [OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION:
	This manual page documents BinaryBurnout's Access Point Control application. By default, it displays 
	the MASTER.lst file (which is by default the file that holds the access point information).

FUNCTIONS:

	add		- Adds new access point with the specified variables. Requires an ESSID and BSSID as
			  minimum. For a full input it requires all input in order: ESSID, BSSID, CHANNEL,
			  ENCRYPTION, CIPHER, KEY. If ENCRYPTION is OPEN, the input string should end there.

	display		- Displays MASTER.lst file. If [OPTIONS] are input, it will display what matches the 
                          [OPTIONS].

	man		- Displays the manual

	rm		- Removes access point specified [OPTIONS].

OPTIONS:

	-e, --essid
		Extended Service Set Identifier

	-b, --bssid
		Basic Service Set Identifier
		
	-ch, --channel
		Channel the access point broadcasts on. The channels can range from 1 to 14. Channels 1 
		through 11 are used in the US (channels 12 and 13 can be used in the US for IEEE 802.11b 
		only). Channels 1 through 13 are used in Japan (channel 14 is only used for IEEE 802.11b 
		and is only valid for DSSS and CCK modes). Channels 1 through 13 are used in the rest of 
		the world.
		
	-enc, --encryption
		Encryption method used could be one of the following...

		OPEN: Open (no encryption used)
		WEP:  Wired Equivalent Privacy
		WPA:  Wi-Fi Protected Access
		WPA2: Wi-Fi Protected Access Version 2

	-cipher
		Algorithm used for encryption and decryption. Could be one of the following...

		CCMP: Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol
		TKIP: Temporal Key Integrirt Protocol
		      * Both of the above use Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) *

	-key
		The encryption key used on access point.

EXAMPLES:

	apcontrol display -ch <channel>
		:: Displays all access points that broadcast on channel <channel>.
	
	apcontrol rm -e <essid>
		:: Removes access point with ESSID <essid>.

* ADD EXAMPLES: *

	apcontrol add -e <essid> -b <bssid>
		:: Minimum variables needed for add function. Adds new access point with ESSID <essid>
		   and BSSID <bssid>.

	apcontrol add -e <essid> -b <bssid> -ch <channel> -enc <encryption> -cipher <cipher> -key <key>
		:: Full add function.

	apcontrol add -e <essid> -b <bssid> -ch <channel> -enc open
		:: Open access point. This will add a new access point with specified variables and auto
		   add the CIPHER, AUTH and KEY variables as "---".

	apcontrol add -e <essid> -b <bssid> -ch <channel> -enc wep
		:: Adds access point with specified variables and ENCRYPTION WEP. Auto adds CIPHER as WEP,
		   AUTH as "---" and KEY as "???".

	apcontrol add -e <essid> -b <bssid> -ch <channel> -enc <wpa/wpa2> -cipher <ccmp/tkip>
		:: Adds access point with specified varables and ENCRYPTION WPA or WPA2 and CIPHER CCMP or
		   TKIP. Auto adds AUTH as PSK and KEY as "???".
